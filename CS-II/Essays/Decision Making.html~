    <h4 class="essayHeader">Decision Bias and ShelterSafe</h4>
    <p class="essay">For as long as human initiative has existed, bias has prevented success. Despite being against slavery, Robert E. Lee's devotion to his home state of Virginia (a bias in itself) led him to abandon his morals and join the losing side of the American Civil War. Robert Oppenheimer's goal to end World War II and attain peace was acheived with the invention of the nuclear bomb, but his bias towards America without regard to the Japanese would create a weapon that would forever continue to loom over any semblance of peace, much to his regret. ADD TRANSITION HERE ShelterSafe's goal of uniting shelters under a common system and increasing knowledge and access to said shelters may face similar failures at the hands of our group's collective biases. Our development team must unite to realize these biases and eliminate them from our decisions to ensure the success of our project.</p>

    <h4 class="essayHeader">Confirmation Bias</h4>
    <p class="essay">Confirmation bias is the phenomenon in which decision makers look at evidence and occurences that support their outlook or goals and disregard those that undermine their vision (Arnott, 1998). This often leads to challenges and obstacles that were ignored in the initial phases of a project's development to come up later, often at a point too far to effectively work around it. The best counter to this bias is thorough research, considering all evidence presented despite how it will affect ShelterSafe's development cycle, rather than cherry-picking information that supports our cause. Potential obstacles and challenges must be considered early into the developmental cycle, and the long-term health of our project should be a large priority. As of now, I feel that we have done a good job managing our confirmation bias, but it definitely will be something that we need to keep in mind as we continue development.</p>


    <h4 class="essayHeader">Desire Bias</h4>
    <p class="essay">Desire bias occurs when one predicts the probability of a desired outcome to be much higher than warranted, solely because it is desired (Arnott, 1998). This bias shows up everywhere, from sports predictions to Wall Street bets. This bias is especially dangerous to especially ambitious projects, and with a project with the scale of ShelterSafe desire bias is a real threat. Designing and programming an app with every feature that we could want within the given timeframe is simply impossible. To combat this bias, we as a team must ensure that our plans match our timeframe despite how hard we promise ourselves we will work or how much we say we want to succeed. I feel that this is best done by sectioning off our project into two distinct development stages: one where we build a functioning skeleton of the app, and another stage where we add features one by one. This ensures that we don't try to work beyond our capabilities by attempting to create multiple complex features at once. Rather, we must ensure that our main app is complete and all basic features required are given priority. </p>

    <h4 class="essayHeader">Linear Bias</h4>
    <p class="essay">Linear bias refers to the fact that when identifying and predicting change, people tend to treat change as a linear function of time. This often does not represent reality: the speed of an object in freefall exponentially increases, how loud a sound is a logarithmic function of the power of the sound waves, and progress in tech (ex. Moore's Law) is exponential (Novella, 2022). This can be applied to our perception of ShelterSafe's workflow: because we are doing well and making progress one week does not guarantee that the same will be true later. When adjusting our schedule to our available time, we can counter this bias in two ways: we can preemptively create extra pockets of time in our schedule in case a development stage takes longer than expected. Simpler and more effective than this, however, is simply researching the process of development for each stage/feature of the app, and adapting the allotted time period based on its conceptual difficulty and our knowledge of it.</p>

    <h4 class="essayHeader">Correlation Bias</h4>
    <p class="essay">Correlation bias occurs when two events take place at the same time and one creates a correlation between them without evidence (Arnott, 1998). I feel that this applies to the group members of ShelterSafe especially, as all did an ISP last year and found success in each of ours. That ISP was made in IGIS, and we had assignments leading up to it that taught us how to use IGIS. Our current ISP is much different, however, being made in Xcode. We must not correlate the assignation of the ISP with success and assume that it will be an experience similar to the last one. This one is different from what we have done before, and no in-school resources or assignments cover what we will have to learn. Our development team must eliminate any notion that this experience is anything like the last, and we need to be prepared to put more effort than we did in the past ISP into this one.</p>

    <h4 class="essayHeader">Conjunction Bias</h4>
    <p class="essay">Often, the probability of conjunctive events is grossly overrated. Conjunctive events are a collection of other events, and we can say a conjunctive event occurred if all the events it encompasses occurred. For example, the completion of a building is a conjunctive event compassing planning, cement work, bricklaying, creating the foundation, and much more (Arnott, 1998). For the building to be completed, all of these must happen. Our ISP is similar in the sense that there are multiple features that encompass our app, and the completion of each is integral to the completion of our app. To prevent overestimating our chance of completing all of these, we should assess each singular part of our project separately and determine how viable it is in the scope of the whole project. Although we have many ideas, I feel that some can and should be eliminated so enough manpower can be allotted to the other sections of our project. </p>

    <h4 class="essayHeader">Finishing Thoughts</h4>
    
    <p class="essay">The biases mentioned here are nowhere near a comprehensive list of all the biases that our gorup will experience over the coming months as we develop ShelterSafe. With each bias, however, comes a method to counter it and look at the bigger picture subjectively. Moving forward, keeping biases and methods to counter them in mind, I am confident that we can succeed in our goal of creating an app that will benefit everyone.</p>
