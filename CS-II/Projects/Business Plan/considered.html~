	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Detect and Deter Drowsiness-Inator (DX3)</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">The aim of this device is to deter drowsiness and keep users awake despite their strongest urges to sleep. This will be done through tracking the user's eyes, and if they close for prolonged periods they will be exposed to external stimuli such as electric shock, sirens, vibrations, and more. I respect the technology and aim of this project, but I don't think I will join for the reason that stimulants like coffee that contain caffeine already curb drowsiness without the need of pain. It certainly would be a fun project to work on though.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/srijishnu-devarapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">RFID ID Labels</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">This project aims to insert unique RFID identifiers into schools and to use these to identify students without human error and decrease needed manpower. I really like this idea, and I feel that it is an effective solution to the ID problem that plagues Allen High School. In addition, these are inexpensive, with the production cost of an RFID tag being under 10 cents. However, one thing that could threaten the integrity of this plan are RFID writers, which are cheap devices that can alter RFID chips to assume the unique indentifier of other chips. This does not invalidate the plan as a whole, as I doubt that many would have the knowledge to do this. However, I feel that this wouldn't provide ample challenge. I have experience with RFID writing and reading already, and I want to try something new. This is a great project though, and the potential here is giant.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/eric-steiner/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Fighting Game (Untitled)</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">The actual page doesn't have a ton of info, but the descriptions put on the spreadsheet give a little bit more info. This group aims to make a 2D platform fighting game. This caught my eye; I grew up on 2D fighting games and making one has been a dream of mine since I was a little kid. I was seriously thinking about joining this group, but after some serious complentation, I came to a realization. I feel that (at least in my opinion) games are often a very personal creation. Most of the ISPs listed on the spreadsheet have the goal of completing X task as effectively as possible. However, games are more than that. They are a form of expression, and thus I feel that I would largely be unhappy with the development, stylistic, and mechanical aspects of the game. If I were to develop a fighting game, I would want it to be purely a representation of my ideas, so I feel I'd be better off making developing a fighting ame a personal prohect uninvolved from the ISPs.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devon-leerssen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Click Battle</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">Click Battle is a clicker game that functions like a basic clicker game, except with the twist that there's a global leaderboard and every click from every player goes to a global tally. I feel that the global leaderboard doesn't really add anything super novel, and that the experience would largely resemble already existing games like Cookie Clicker. For this reason, I think this would be something that doesn't really fill a new niche. Additionally, the simplicity would make this something that would be finished in a very short timeframe, and offer no real challenge to developers. I want to learn something new and push my boundaries with this project, and I don't think this project would do that.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tahmid-rahman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">AeroFli</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">This project aims to create self-flying places. This project was conceived in a response to the shortage of airline pilots which has plaged the industry since COVID-19 emerged. I think that this project fails to consider that planes of this era essentially run on an autopilot system, and the competence of the pilot has no real gravity on the fate of flights. For this reason, I feel that this niche is largely filled. While the development of this project would be nuanced and filled with challenge, I don't think that it will be able to displace already existing autopilot systems. Addiionally, people are hesitant to trust unmanned vehicles. Take the elevator for example: for years after its invention elevator operators were hired to give people a sense of safety, although they served no real purpose. For these reasons, I feel that there are better projects to choose from.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zaenb-al-ameri/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">TheFit</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">This concept aims to create an outfit planner app that takes into account hairstyle, closet inventory, skin tone, body type, and more. I really like this project's idea, as I often find myself sitting there staring at my closet wondering what I could wear that would match. Honestly, for this project I don't see any reason why I would not want to work on it, except for the fact that I like my idea a little bit more. Something I would change is that upon the creation of an account, a person would be presented with an array of outfits and select those that visually appealed to them. This ensures that people with a more experimental sense of style are equally represented by the app, rather than just the general idea of what people think looks good.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/james-dungan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">On Track</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">On Track's aim is to create a service that attracts users to national parks through the providing of information regarding campsites, distance, and more. This is a great idea, and it's aplicatiions are wide in use. It is reminiscent of Tesla's map of charging stations, something that my project also shares influence from. However, I feel that the limiting of this to just national parks fills a niche so small there is almost no overlap between the general population and a general population. For this reason, I wouldn't work on this project. I would suggest to broaden the scope to include other outdoor recreational areas, like state parks, beaches, privately owned beaches with free attendance, and more. I too appreciate national parks, and I really like what this project is doing to these often ignored hidden gems of our nation.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/isaac-pandyan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">SmartShop</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">SmartShop works to eliminate the hassle of searching for suitable clothes. It filters clothes from all over the web based on certain criteria, ensuring that you don't have to go to individual websites searching for the same thing over and over again. I like this idea a lot, as this is something I've suffered an uncountable amount of times. This is a case where I don't have any major gripes with this project, but there also isn't any one factor that really attracts me to it either. I'd rather do my project, and that's what's keeping me from accepting it. I hope that this project does come to fruition, however. Good luck to these students! </p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-jershin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">3D Rendering Algorithm</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText">This project will utilize various mathematical functions to create a more efficient algorithm for rendering objects/shadows and such in 3D games. This idea caught my attention because of my interest in game development. Reading the explanation over, however, I realize that I know absolutely nothing about the math required to do this. The most advanced skill I have that could be applied here is vector addition, and that doesn't even scratch the surface. I want to learn more about this, but I feel that this ISP, if I were to join, would be more of an experience where I sit and learn rather than learn and create at the same time. For this reason, I didn't choose to do this project. Good luck to this project, I'd love to see it succeed.</p>

	  <h3 class="generalText"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">FINAL CHOICE: ShelterSafe</a></h3>
	  <p class="generalText"> ShelterSafe, my own project, aims to end the issue of lack of awareness regarding shelters in cases of emergency. My goal is to create an app with a Pokémon Go-esque map that displays nearby shelters and the statistics concerning those shelters (food, space, distance, etc.). I have a strong vision set for this in my mind already, along with my partner, and I want to ensure that it comes to fruition. This was personally inspired by stories of the 1970 Bangladesh Cyclone, which killed more people than any other tropical cyclone and affected my extended family greatly, as well as the current floods that ravage Pakistan at this moment. I chose to continue with my project because I feel that it poses a challenge whilst being realistic. It is ambitious, but doesn't cross the line into unviable. At the same time, it'd tackle a major issue that nobody is really trying to solve, and it aligns with my personal values and interests.</p>
