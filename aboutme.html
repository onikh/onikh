    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <br>
  <p>Hi! My name is Onik Hoque and I am a junior at Allen High School. I am in Mr. Ben's third period CS2, and I also took CS1 last year. I started playing basketball this summer, and it's become a major pasttime of mine. Music is a big thing for me; I think that when I grow up I would most like to be a singer. CS is also something I ifnd really interesting, and a hoping to get more into this school year. This year, I am hoping to expand my knowledge in computer science, and see what kind of avenues open.<p>
