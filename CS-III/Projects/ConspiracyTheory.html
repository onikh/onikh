      <p class="subtitle">Relationship Between Conspiracy and Technology</p>
      <p class="essay">Although conspiracy theories have existed in some fashion as long as complex language itself has, the advent of technology has made it easier for ideals of all kinds including conspiracies to spread. Those who believe in theories not believed by fact can now quickly find a group of like minded people, and force each other deeper down a path that rejects analysis and observation in favor of biased and unjustified theory. </p>

      <br>

      <p class="subtitle">Social Corporations and Algorithms</p>
      <p class="essay">Because watchtime almost directly generates ad revenue, it's in the best interest of companies like Instagram and YouTube to ensure that viewers are engaged for as long as possible. To maximize watchtime, these apps monitor how long a user watches certain types of videos and push those with longer viewtimes in favor of others, as long as monitoring user likes and searches. This narrows the types of content for each individual based on the habits and preferences detected by their app, and from here the same algorithm is applied, often resulting in a further narrowing of content. This is called the feedback loop, and can continue narrowing a user's content to only the most engaging kinds of content. Unfortunately, this oftentimes end up being conspiracy theories and unverifiable news, as the sensational claims presented with exaggerated circumstantial evidence often can hold a viewer's attention even for those that wouldn't believe the theory. This phenomenon occuring on more common platforms like YouTube can eventually result in a pursuit of this kind of information, leading to communities dedicated to absurd conspiracies forming and growing on other more topic-oriented platforms like 4chan and Reddit.</p>


      <br>


      <p class="subtitle">Company Action</p>
      
      <p class="essay">Very few platforms have attempted to combat this issue, but Instagram has taken a route that has proved to be at least somewhat effective in promoting the truth. In addition to the usual list of reasons that a user can report a post for, Instagram has recently included an option to report a video for being untruthful or misleading. These videos are then sent to a live review team, who can verify if the claimed report is valid. If so, to maintain the platform's freedom of speech (to an extent) policy, the videos are not removed but contain a disclaimer at the beginning. These warn of the misleading information, and additionally provide a link to a fact-checking database (ex. Snopes) that varies with each post. Although this isn't enough to affect the most hardcore conspiracy believers, who will not believe anything told to them by a government or a corporation, most people that stop and consider claims before they make a decision benefit from this feature. Twitter's policy, in my opinion, is one of the worse ways to handle this: the bans and restrictions placed on accounts are seemingly made based on whether what the posts are sharing are relevant to the interests of the company or not. In the case of the decision to ban Trump for using Twitter to incite the events on Januray 6th, it was a very necessary and proper action, but the rest of their attempts to block harmful conspiracy seemingly target claims against the company, such as the claim that CEO Musk conpsired with the US to stage a coupe in Bolivia, or abuses against employees.  </p>


      <br>

      
      <p class="subtitle">The Future of Conspiracy</p>

      <p class="essay">Although efforts to combat conspiracy have increased, the exponential growth of lnkage due to technology makes it hard to keep up with the continous waves of conspiracy created. When corporations take action against conspiracy, other platforms crop up to keep it alive, such as was the case with Twitter and Truth Social, a platform created by Trump that fostered election conspiracy. Many have called for direct government action in dictating what information can and can't be placed on social platforms, but this is an overreach of power and can be easily abused. Preventative meausures such as those previously mentioned in use by Instagram can be effective, but I think that the solution lies in education. Plano ISD's World Affairs class centers around current news, the study of global dynamics, and sourcing information from reliable places. As this new generation of schoolchildren are thrust into the digital world with minds not yet fully mature enough to prevent deep formative effects on them, such as the descent into a feedback loop altering beliefs, it is integral that early on we have a class that teaches proper digital citizenship, distinguishing the truth from illusion, and world affairs so that the algorithmic feedback loop trap that has captured so many of us will not have the strength that it does now.</p>
