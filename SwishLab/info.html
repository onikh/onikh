        <p class="title">Swish Lab</p>

        <p class="essay">Swish Lab is an app designed to enchance training through machine learning algorithms for basketball. Without a coach or someone to give live feedback, players often keep making the same mistakes. The provision of an image detection model and multiple algorithms help users gauge their effort put in on the court, their efficiency, their habits, and other aspects of the game we love.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Features</p>
        <p class="essay">The core of Swish Lab lies in the workouts. Users have access to four workouts: the intensity tracker, where users are free to do whatever they'd like. Whenever they finish, the app will visualize the player's movement over time, by recording the rate at which they dribbled. A graph is produced with the rate of dribbling in dribbles/10s, which can give an accurate and truthful metric of the player's effort put in during their training. The other three workouts are free throws, three pointers, and an all around shooting activity. These are effective in determining a player's efficiency and their consistency. Similarly to how dribbles are counted and visualized, these drills takes the amount of successful shots per 30 seconds and plots it, resulting in a rate of scoring. This, combined with the ability to tell whether or not players miss or make a shot, is incredible towards helping players realize and target issues with consistency and efficiency on the court.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Friends </p>
        <p class="essay">
            Swish Lab also has a robust friend system. You can send any user a friend request based on their unique username, and once you do that you can access their stats. You're able to see their lifetime totals, efficiency from free throw, three point, and regular field goals, and also be able to see the graph for their most recent training session. In addition, you can delete friends and decline incoming friend requests.
