    <h2>WHY A PORTFOLIO?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Creating a Digital Portfolio comes with only benefits, and everyone with something to show for themselves should create one. Digital Portfolios create an easy one-stop shop for people to display their skills and avtivity, generating an easy to navigate hub for all of one's projects. For programmers, creating the Digital Portfolio is a project in itself, and is an asset to anyone's resume. It gives one essential knowledge and experience that they very well may be using for their jobs, if they work in CS. For freelance artists, programmers, writers, musicians, and more, Digital Portfolios are absolutely integral to their income, giving them a place to display their past work and encourage potential clients to hire them.</p>
