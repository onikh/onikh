    <h2 class="generalHeader">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <br>
    <h3 class="generalHeader">Summary</h3>
  <p class="generalText">Hi! My name is Onik Hoque and I am a junior at Allen High School. I am in Mr. Ben's third period CS2, and I also took CS1 last year. I started playing basketball this summer, and it's become a major pasttime of mine. Music is a big thing for me; I think that when I grow up I would most like to be a singer. CS is also something I find really interesting, and a hoping to get more into this school year. This year, I am hoping to expand my knowledge in computer science, and see what kind of avenues open.</p>

  <p class="generalText">I was born in Dallas, but moved to the suburbs of Washington DC when I was 8. I lived there for 4 years, and during that time I really got to the know the people and find a place I truly considered home. I moved back at the age of 12, but those years were very formative for me, and I consider myself as having grown up in DC. I credit the forests and creeks of the land with fostering my sense of curiosity, the same sense that I apply today to computer science.</p>


  <br>
  <h3 class="generalHeader">Goals for the Future</h3>
  <p class="generalText">  There's a lot of things I want to accomplish before I graduate. My goal is to attend UTD or UT, but I think those come second to the set of small goals that keep me occupied day to day. I want to develop a Street Fighter-esque fighting game, with my own original music and assets. Adding on to music, which is a huge influence on me, I'd like to make music and perhaps release an album or EP. Lastly, I'd like to get better at sports, especially basketball. My goal for the past year has been to touch the rim of a 10 foot hoop (really difficult at 5'7), which I was able to achieve in August of 2022. Now my goal is to dunk, and it'll take a lot of work to get there.</p>
