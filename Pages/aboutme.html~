    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <br>
  <p>Hi! My name is Onik Hoque and I am a junior at Allen High School. I am in Mr. Ben's third period CS2, and I also took CS1 last year. I started playing basketball this summer, and it's become a major pasttime of mine. Music is a big thing for me; I think that when I grow up I would most like to be a singer. CS is also something I ifnd really interesting, and a hoping to get more into this school year. This year, I am hoping to expand my knowledge in computer science, and see what kind of avenues open.</p>

      <p>I was born in Dallas, but moved to the suburbs of Washington DC when I was 8. I lived there for 4 years, and during that time I really got to the know the people and find a place I truly considered home. I moved back at the age of 12, but those years were very formative for me, and I consider myself as having grown up in DC. I credit the forests and creeks of the land with fostering my sense of curiosity, the same sense that I apply today to computer science.</p>
